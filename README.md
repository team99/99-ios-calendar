# 99-ios-calendar

Almost fully-configurable calendar view for iOS applications that runs entirely on Rx. 

Reactive programming allows us to produce truly decoupled components that are open to extensions but closed for modications. For example, date selections in a month view are driven by a selected date stream (**Observable[Set[Date]]**), so if we want to add a weekday bar view with logic such that clicking on a weekday (e.g. **Monday**) selects the entire date range (corresponding to said weekday), all we need to do is just push a custom set of selected dates into the stream and we will see those dates being selected automatically.

If ever so required, we can write bridges that connect imperative and reactive to cater to legacy code, but it's best to minimize such bridges if we want to build scalable applications.
